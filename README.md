# DynamoDbOfficerReservation


My professor wanted asked the class to choose one of AWS's many services and use it in a realistic fashion for a term project. I came up with the idea to create an officer reservation app using AWS's DynamoDb after making reservations at a restaurant to eat. This AWS/Maven DynamoDb project allowed a user to add an officer to the database, delete an officer from the database, retreive an officers information by multiple parameters, edit an officer in the database, and display the entire contents of the table through the command line. Without any prior knowledge of how to use AWS, I was successfully able to complete it following AWS's pdfs and Youtube tutorials. Now that a few years have passed, I'm confident that I could stand it up as a Java Web App and allow users to hit the end points through a URL instead of the command line.
