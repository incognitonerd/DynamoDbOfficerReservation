# DynamoDbOfficerReservation  
  
  
For my senior project, my professor asked the class to choose one of the many new cloud service options at the time and use it in a realistic fashion for a term project. I came up with the idea to create an officer reservation app using AWS's DynamoDb after making reservations at a restaurant to eat. Luckily for me, I had taken a Cloud Computing course that gave students access to AWS for a year a term or two earlier. I came across DynamoDb after doing some research and used it for my senior project. Without any prior knowledge of how to use DynaoDb, I was successfully able to complete it following AWS's pdfs and Youtube tutorials. I created users, groups, and access controls for my team members as Admin using IAM.    
      
    
      
  
This AWS/Maven DynamoDb project allows a user to add an officer to the database, delete an officer from the database, retreive an officers information by multiple parameters, edit an officer in the database, and display the entire contents of the table through the command line. Now that a few years have passed, I'm confident that I could stand it up as a Java Web App and allow users to hit the end points through a URL instead of the command line.
